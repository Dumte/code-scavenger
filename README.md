# Code Scavenger: Algorithm Efficiency Demo

This small React/Vite project is designed as an educational playground for
students learning about algorithm efficiency. The app presents a friendly,
interactive challenge where you convert wasteful code into an optimized
version using basic programming concepts like loops.

## How to use

1. Start the development server (`npm run dev`).
2. Open the app in your browser (typically http://localhost:5173).
3. A welcome card will greet you with instructions; click **Start the
   Challenge** to begin.
4. Follow the prompts on-screen to experiment with code optimization.

The goal is to make the robot cheer using fewer lines of code! Enjoy
iterating and learning.

## Credits

- Developed for classroom use by your instructor (adapted from a
  Scratch-based exercise).
- Original concept and teaching materials prepared by the teacher.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
